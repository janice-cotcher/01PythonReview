#1 For the following practice questions, put brackets around groups of numbers to see how the results change:
# practice a
print(2 * 4 + 10 * 3)

# practice b
print(16 - 2 * 5 // 3 + 1)

# practice c
print(2 ** 2 % 3 * 3)

#2 Store your age in a variable as a number. Using that variable, print out a 
# message that states your name and what your age is.


# 3 Using the arithmetic operators, print at at least 4 additional statements 
# that result in 8 using strings and numbers. You can only use each operator 
# once. I completed one with addition:
# addition
print("5 + 3 = " + str(5+3))
