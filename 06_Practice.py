# 1. Like the previous examples, store a brief text-based message in a
# variable, and then print out that message.




# 2. Like practice #1, store a brief text-based message in a variable, and
# then print out that message. Change the value of your variable to a new
# message, and then print out the second message as well. The program should
# print out two different messages.

# 3. Store your name as a variable and print a message using concatenation of
# the two variables



# 4. Try to print the same statement as above, but this time, combine your
# name and message in the print statement.



# 5. Find a quote from a famous person and print the quote and name (similar
# to the previous example). Don't forget that the quotation marks should be
# printed.


# 6. Repeat practice #5 but this time, save the famous person's name as
# variable.
